## Question 5

Write a version of itoa that accepts three arguments instead of two. The third argument is a minimum field width; the converted number must be padded with blanks on the left if necessary to make if wide enough. Also, write a main function that calls the function with 3 different examples.

Compile Steps:

	gcc q5.c	

Output:

	Result 1:  -1019
	Result 2:           -1019
	Result 3:                -1019
