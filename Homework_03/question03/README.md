## Question 3

(K&R Exercise 3-1) Our (K&R) binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would suffice (at the price of more tests outside). Write a version with ony one test inside the loop. Also, write a main function that calls the function with 3 different examples. If you're curious, you can also measure the difference in run-time.

Compile Steps:
	
	gcc q3.c

Output:

	Location of 3 in Array 1: 3
	Location of 9 in Array 2: 4
	Location of 91 in Array 3: 7
