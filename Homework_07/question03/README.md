## Question 3

Use the hash map struct that we created in class to find the intersection (common elements) between two arrays of integers. Your function prototype should be:  
<code>void intersection(int output[], int input[]);</code>

Show that your function works with a few examples.

Compile Steps:

	gcc q3.c

Output:

	Common Elements:
	5
	6
	Common Elements:
	15
	52
	Common Elements:
	1
	6
	12
