## Question 3

(Eckel, 5.12) Place objects of the Hen class from question 1 in a Stack. Fetch them out and print them (if you have not already done so, you will need to add Hen::print() to print out the info stored in the Hen class (e.g. the Hen's name)).

Compile Steps:

	g++ q3.cpp

Output:

	Order of Hens added to the stack:
	Hen's name is: rebHen
	Hen's name is: kevHen
	Hen's name is: Henry
	Hen's name is: Henny
	Hen's name is: Bird

	Order of Hens removed from the stack:
	Hen's name is: Bird
	Hen's name is: Henny
	Hen's name is: Henry
	Hen's name is: kevHen
	Hen's name is: rebHen
