## Question 3

Write the logic of invert(x,p,n) that prints x with the n bits that begin at position p inverted (i.e., 1 changed into 0 and vice versa), leaving the others unchanged. As an example, use x=7, p=2, n=1. In addition, provide another example of your choice. (K&R Exercise 2-7) 

Compilation Step:

	gcc q3.c

Output:

	For x = 7, p = 2, n = 1, result = 3
	For x = 14, p = 1, n = 2, result = 8
